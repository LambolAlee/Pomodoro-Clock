#### Brief introduction:

&emsp;&emsp;This project is inspired by the Pomodoro technique when I learn the theory of time management. At the beginning, I wrote a simple CLI program to realize the function. Then I wanted to make a GUI program which will make the program easier to use. I know that there are plenty of apps in the app store which can do the same thing as the program I made and can do better than mine. But it’s awesome to make one on my own.

#### Attention:

&emsp;&emsp;The application is still under developed though I have realized the core function. There are some functions that are not that important but can give the user a more fluent using experience.
